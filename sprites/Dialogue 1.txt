 NARRATOR: We follow our protagonist Westlee as he hazards the outside world in pursiot of produce and toiletries. Itemized list in hand, he ventures forth.
 
 MOTHER: "Be wary the world of perversion in which you walk my little Weshee; it's a world of sin and decline and perhaps worst of all GAMES, the devil's most insidious tool for making you his plaything.""
 
 WESTLEE: "Ugh, I just can't get mother out of my mind. What was it my therapist said? 'Focus on your steps, really feel the impact of every footfall'. He even gave me this digital pedometer pet thing. He said it would help me get over both my agoraphobia and my ludophobia. After all those years spent campaigning against MAZES & MONSTERS by my mom's side I have to take baby steps to see the world in a different light."
 
 SHADEY: "Hey man, I'm your digital pet. I grow and get hungry as you walk!"
 
 WESTLEE: "Why do you look well, uh, so monstrous?"
 
 SHADEY: "I don't know man, that's just how the Asians programmed me. Don't know what to tell ya. Now walk and get ready to press a button when I'm hungry. I'm loud and obnoxious and you're probably going to end up killing me. You'll love it!"
 
 WESTLEE: "I don't want to see you die."
 
 SHADEY: "Well aren't you just the sweetest little thing. Well start walking and pay attention. Maybe I'll evolve into something cuter for you? Oh and hey, watch out for those cracks. You know what they say, right? 'STEP ON A CRACK, BREAK YOUR MOTHER'S BACK!'"
 
 WESTLEE: "Is this what they call a minigame?"
